## Static Equipment Engineering Analysis Tools

This repository is the catch-all for miscellaneous scripts that I have built to perform quick mechanical integrity-related calculations in my day-to-day work. These are designed to be very reusable and conservative to act as a preliminary screening before further rigorous fitness assessments are executed to get baseline information of the equipment's health given inspection inputs. It's also a convenient place to centralize all of my calculator tools.
